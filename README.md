A [skiplist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) provides a way of storing
data with `log(i)` access, insertion and removal for an element in the `i`th
position.

There are three kinds of collections defined here:

- **SkipList** This behaves like nearly any other double-ended list.
- **OrderedSkipList** Ensures that the elements are always sorted. Still allows
  for access nodes at a given index.
- **SkipMap** A map in which the keys are ordered.

Documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/skiplist) and the cargo
crate can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/skiplist).
